The classify function in the process_and_classify python file will call on functions in the LinearClassifier and wrangle_data scripts. 

The DataWrangling and LinearTraining Jupyter files show how the above functions were originally developed and used. 
The DataWrangling file must be run in completion before the LinearTraining file has the appropriate files in the directory to run to completion.
The LinearTraining file in particular shows how the classifier was trained.
